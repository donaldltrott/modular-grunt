# modular-grunt
Self project for remembering how to make a modular Grunt project rather that including all
of the grunt configs into a single file. The variables and files included are to work for
the following file structure.

```
|-- assets/
|    |-- fonts
|    |-- img
|    |-- sass
|-- core/
|-- modules/
|-- tests/
|    |-- unit
|    |-- e2e
|-- index.html
|-- .jshintrc
|-- package.json

```
